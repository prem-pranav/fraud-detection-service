# 🛡️ Advanced Fraud Detection System

> A production-ready, financially optimized machine learning pipeline for real-time transaction risk assessment.

This repository implements an end-to-end fraud detection solution that bridges the gap between exploratory research and high-stakes production environments. The system is engineered for **stability**, **calibration**, and **profit maximization**.

## 🚦 Key Project Highlights

- **🎯 Precision Calibration**: Uses Isotonic Regression to map model scores to true empirical fraud probabilities ($P(Fraud|Score)$).
- **💸 Financial Optimization**: Integrated an optimal decision threshold (**0.267**) mathematically tuned to minimize total business loss (Fraud Cost + Review Friction).
- **🛡️ Production Stability**: Achieved a highly stable **91.90% AUC-ROC** and **60.04% PR-AUC** with cross-validation variance $<0.3\%$.
- **⚡ Decoupled Inference**: Standalone `--predict` mode supports large-scale batch scoring without retraining.

## 📈 Engineering Roadmap

### 1️⃣ Exploratory Foundation

Understand data distributions and established a baseline preprocessing strategy to handle high-cardinality categorical variables.

- 📖 **Walkthrough**: [Exploratory Data Analysis](eda.md)
- 💻 **Script**: `eda.py`

### 2️⃣ Stability & Performance Research

A rigorous two-phase study was conducted to select the optimal model architecture and class-balancing weights.

- 📖 **Walkthrough**: [Model Performance Analysis](model_performance_analysis.md)
- 💻 **Script**: `model_performance_analysis.py`

### 3️⃣ Production-Grade Development

Implementation of the "Gold Model" with robust column harmonization, stateful encoding, and probability calibration.

- 📖 **Walkthrough**: [Production Development Walkthrough](model_development.md)
- 💻 **Script**: `model_development.py`

### 4️⃣ Actionable Decision Layer

The system translates ML scores into clear business recommendations: `AUTO_PASS`, `MANUAL_REVIEW`, or `AUTO_BLOCK`.

## ⚙️ Environment Setup

Before running any scripts, ensure you have initialized the virtual environment and installed the dependencies.

```powershell
# 1. Create the virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# 2. Activate the environment
.\.venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install required libraries
pip install -r python-libraries.txt
```

## 🚀 Execution Guide

This project contains several scripts for different phases of the ML lifecycle. All commands should be run within the activated virtual environment.

### 1️⃣ Initial Data Discovery (EDA)
Run the exploratory analysis to generate data distribution plots and initial insights.
```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python eda.py
```
*Outputs: Visualizations in `images/eda-img/`*

### 2️⃣ Model Stability Research
Execute the comprehensive stability analysis to compare LightGBM vs. XGBoost and find optimal weights.
```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python model_performance_analysis.py
```
*Outputs: Stability plots and cost curves in `images/model-perf-analysis-img/`*

### 3️⃣ Production Training
Train the final "Gold Model" with full data, fit the probability calibrator, and save production artifacts.
```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python model_development.py --train
```
*Artifacts: `models/*.pkl`*

### 4️⃣ Standalone Inference
Score target data using the calibrated production model.

**Full Test Set:**
```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python model_development.py --predict
```

**Custom Input Batch:**
```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python model_development.py --predict --txn my_data_txn.csv --id my_data_id.csv --out final_results.csv --limit 1000
```
